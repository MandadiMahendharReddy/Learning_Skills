# ðŸ”’ CHALLENGE: Online Course Platform System

# ðŸ“Œ REQUIREMENTS:
# 1. Create an abstract base class `Course` using ABC module
#    - Define abstract method: course_info()

# 2. Create two child classes `FreeCourse` and `PaidCourse` that inherit from `Course`
#    - Each should override course_info() and display different messages

# 3. Add encapsulation:
#    - Make course name and instructor private
#    - Provide methods to get/set them properly

# 4. Create a method enroll() in both child classes, but with different behavior (Polymorphism)
#    - FreeCourse: prints "Enrolled successfully, no payment needed!"
#    - PaidCourse: prints "Enrolled successfully after payment!"

# 5. Create objects of both classes and test:
#    - course_info()
#    - enroll()
#    - getting/setting course name using encapsulated method

# ðŸ’¡ Example Output:
# Course: Python Basics by John
# Enrolled successfully, no payment needed!

# Course: Data Science Pro by Alice
# Enrolled successfully after payment!
