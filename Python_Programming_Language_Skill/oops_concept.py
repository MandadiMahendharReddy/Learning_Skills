# 💸 OOP Challenge: Personal Finance Tracker (Income + Expenditure with Categories)

# 🔒 1. Abstraction:
# - Create an abstract class `Transaction` with:
#   - Private attributes: __amount, __description
#   - Abstract method: get_summary()
#   - Concrete method: get_amount() to return amount

# 🔐 2. Encapsulation:
# - Protect amount and description with __
# - Provide public getter methods for each

# 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 3. Inheritance & 🔁 4. Polymorphism:
# - Create two child classes:
#   1. `Income`: overrides get_summary() to print: "Income: ₹amount from [desc]"
#   2. `Expense`: overrides get_summary() to print: "Spent ₹amount on [desc]"

# - Also, add categories to Expense like "Food", "Bills", "Travel", etc.

# 🧪 Test Code:
# - Create a list of transactions: some Income, some Expense
# - Print all transaction summaries
# - Calculate total income, total expenses, and balance
# - Show category-wise expense summary (optional bonus)

# Expected Output
# Income: ₹15000 from Freelancing
# Spent ₹500 on Food
# Spent ₹1000 on Bills
# Spent ₹2000 on Travel
# Total Income: ₹15000
# Total Expenses: ₹3500
# Balance: ₹11500
